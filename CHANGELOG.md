# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Remove the pre-reply receive wait for Flex USB HID while retaining receive-loop
  event servicing and the command-in-progress guard during review.

- Reduce repeated account-key derivation, point decoding, and diversifier hashing
  while validating shielded transactions, preserving per-action checks. Reuse full
  coordinates for fixed and locally derived points while retaining Ledger’s
  randomized multiplication and validation of external points. Retain normalized
  validation keys across actions under the checked account path and wipe them
  before review or reset.

## 3.9.3

Security release addressing the findings of an external code security scan of 3.9.2.

- Draw the randomness of nonces and blinding factors through a syscall whose failure can be
  checked, and refuse to sign when it reports one, instead of signing over a buffer the device
  never filled
- Zeroize RedPallas signing keys and the secret intermediates of a signature, and redact them
  from debug formatting
- Zeroize the Orchard spending key, through a regenerated vendor patch so the change survives the
  next dependency refresh
- Stop logging the randomized spend authorizing key and the Orchard viewing key
- Refuse a `HASH_INPUT_START` continuation sent before the transaction has been reviewed or after
  it has completed, and refuse any legacy round that would resume a completed transaction
- Bind one Exchange approval to one signed transaction, so a partial signature on a multi-input
  transaction can no longer be followed by a second transaction under the same approval
- Cover `locktime` and `expiry_height` by the transaction review, which now runs on the header
  `HASH_SIGN` carries rather than at the end of the output stream
- Display the outputs of a transaction that pays only itself, which the change filter would
  otherwise have left with no visible destination and no visible amount
- Require the hardening BIP-44 mandates on a change path, and the app's own hardened prefixes on
  an exported derivation path
- Refuse to sign when a change output returns to a different account than the one being spent,
  on both the legacy and the PCZT paths, and whether that output is transparent or a shielded
  note the review never shows
- Refuse a transparent input whose scriptPubKey is not the 25-byte P2PKH shape, the only one the
  app can sign for, rather than signing over a script no key it derives can spend
- Raise the transparent input bound to a count measured on the smallest device, which pinning that
  shape makes affordable by fixing what each input retains
- Bound the input script size the legacy signing parser will allocate for
- Bound the Orchard derivations of one run, which the Secure Element does not reclaim before the
  next power cycle
- Refuse a swap amount or fee that Zcash cannot represent, rather than keeping its low 64 bits
- Refuse a swap whose destination carries an extra ID, which a transparent Zcash output has
  nowhere to hold
- Show each memo with the output it belongs to, under a label carrying that output's index
- Bound what a transaction's memos may claim on the heap, and allocate what is kept fallibly
- Refuse a request to display an address in the mode that has no displayable form
- Name the exported account on the viewing-key confirmation screen
- Move the Ledger SDK to 1.37.0, which refuses an APDU arriving while a command is still being
  processed

## 3.9.2

- Accept a P2SH (t3) `scriptPubKey` on a transparent output, displaying it for review instead of
  refusing the transaction outright
- Require a five-component BIP-44 path for a change output, so a ZIP-32 account path can no longer
  be accepted as change and remove an output from the review screen
- Restrict the derivation paths accepted by public-key and viewing-key export to the app's own
  prefixes, and answer with a status word where the derivation syscall aborted
- Include the Ironwood node in the signature digest of every V6 transaction, with its empty-input
  value when the bundle carries no action, and accept an empty Ironwood bundle (ZIP 229)
- Reject an Ironwood bundle on a transaction that declared V5
- Accept only the documented P1 values for `GET_TRUSTED_INPUT`
- Refuse a trusted input for an output index the transaction does not contain
- Refuse a V4 transaction carrying shielded components, whose txid this parser does not cover
- Bound the legacy parser's shielded component counts and the PCZT transparent script size
- Build `pasta_curves` with `repr-c`, which the point conversion in `ledger_zcash_crypto` relies on,
  and enforce the layout with a compile-time assertion
- Stop the reply to an unsupported instruction from varying with P1/P2
- Bound the Ironwood PCZT parser's stack usage to the Orchard path's, and keep the Orchard and
  Ironwood note ciphertexts off the action-finalisation frame
- Reject a V2 note plaintext version byte in an Ironwood bundle
- Refuse to sign when a shielded output address cannot be encoded, instead of displaying raw bytes
- Zeroize the account's Orchard viewing keys along with the transaction context
- Return an error instead of panicking when the spend authorizing key derives to zero
- Run the `ledger_zcash_crypto` unit tests under the SDK test harness
- Update the vendored `orchard` to 0.15.5 and `zcash_primitives` to 0.30.0
